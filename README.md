# esp32-home-automation-telegram-bot
ESP32-based Home Automation project using WiFi and web server. Control devices via browser with real-time updates. Features include GPIO control, LED status, relay switching, and responsive UI. Efficient code with minimal memory use. Ideal for smart home DIYers. Powered by Arduino IDE and ESPAsyncWebServer.


This IoT project demonstrates how to control four home appliances using an ESP32 microcontroller and the Telegram app, accessible from anywhere in the world. The system allows you to toggle relays via Telegram bot commands like /relay1_on or /relay1_off, and also monitor their real-time status with the /relay_state command. Even without an internet connection, the appliances can still be controlled manually using physical switches connected to the ESP32. The project features step-by-step instructions on how to create a Telegram bot using BotFather and retrieve the bot token and chat ID using IDBot. Additionally, it covers hardware setup using a 4-channel relay module, GPIO configuration, and best practices like PCB design using JLCPCB. The Arduino code is simple and efficient, integrating Wi-Fi, relay control, Telegram messaging, and manual switch functionality.
